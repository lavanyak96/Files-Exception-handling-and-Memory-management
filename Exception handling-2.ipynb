    "when creating a custom exception, it is recommended to inherit from the Exception class (or one of its subclasses) for several important reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency and Compatibility: Inheriting from the Exception class ensures that your custom exception class follows the same structure and conventions as built-in exceptions. This consistency makes your custom exceptions compatible with existing error-handling mechanisms in Python, such as try and except blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Catch-All Capability: By inheriting from the Exception class, your custom exception can be caught in a broad except block that catches general exceptions, allowing you to handle your custom exception along with other exceptions in a uniform way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability and Understanding: When someone else reads your code or uses your library, inheriting from Exception makes it clear that your custom exception is intended to represent an error or exceptional condition. It enhances the readability and maintainability of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future Compatibility: Python may introduce new exception types in the future. By using the Exception base class, your custom exception will remain compatible with future versions of Python and any changes or additions to the exception hierarchy."

    "1.Use Specific Exception Types: Catch and handle specific exceptions rather than catching broad exceptions like Exception. This allows you to handle errors more precisely and prevents unintended consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Avoid Bare except: Avoid using bare except clauses (i.e., except: without specifying an exception type) because they catch all exceptions, making it difficult to diagnose issues. Instead, specify the expected exception(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Use finally for Cleanup: When you need to ensure that certain actions are taken regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, use the finally block for cleanup operations (e.g., closing files, releasing resources).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Keep try Blocks Minimal: Keep the code inside try blocks as minimal as possible to narrow down the scope of the potential error. This makes it easier to locate the source of the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Log Exceptions: Use a logging framework like Python's logging module to log exceptions along with relevant information. This helps in tracking errors in production systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Document Exception Handling: Document the purpose and expected behavior of exception handling in your code, especially if you are using custom exception classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Use User-Defined Exceptions: Create and use custom (user-defined) exception classes when dealing with application-specific error conditions. This enhances code readability and maintainability."
